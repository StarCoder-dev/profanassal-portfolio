      <h1>Tips for Clean and Modern Web Design</h1>
      <p>Simple tricks I use to keep my designs user-friendly and professional.</p>
   

    <main>
      <section>
        <p>When it comes to web design, I’ve learned that simplicity often speaks louder than complexity. A clean, modern design not only looks beautiful but also makes your website easier to use and more enjoyable to explore. Over time, I’ve picked up a few techniques that help me keep my designs both stylish and user-friendly — and I’m excited to share them with you!</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>1. Start with a Clear Layout</h3>
            <p>Every great design begins with structure. I like to use grids and consistent spacing to organize content. This helps guide the user’s eye and ensures that everything feels balanced. A clean layout gives the impression of professionalism — even before the user reads a single word.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>2. Keep Colors Minimal</h3>
            <p>Modern web design often follows the rule of less is more. I usually stick to one primary color, one accent color, and neutral backgrounds (like white, gray, or soft tones). This makes the interface look elegant and keeps the focus on what truly matters — the content.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>3. Use Readable Typography</h3>
            <p>Typography is one of the most underrated parts of web design. I always choose clean, modern fonts like Poppins, Inter, or Roboto for body text and something a bit bolder for headings. Good contrast between text and background improves readability and makes your design more professional.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>4. Make It Responsive</h3>
            <p>A modern website must look great on every device — from desktops to smartphones. I make sure to test layouts at different screen sizes and adjust elements using flexbox or grid in CSS. A responsive design not only improves usability but also boosts SEO.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>5. Add Subtle Animations</h3>
            <p>Small, meaningful animations — like smooth hover effects or gentle transitions — can make a big difference. They give life to your design without overwhelming users. My rule: if an animation doesn’t improve the user experience, it doesn’t belong there.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>6. Focus on White Space</h3>
            <p>White space (or negative space) is your best friend. It gives your content room to breathe and helps users focus on important elements. A cluttered website feels stressful; a clean one feels calm and modern.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>7. Keep Navigation Simple</h3>
            <p>The navigation bar is like a roadmap for your visitors. I make sure my menus are short, clear, and easy to find. Using sticky headers or simple dropdowns helps people move around effortlessly.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>8. Test and Refine</h3>
            <p>No design is perfect on the first try. I often revisit my projects, gather feedback, and tweak small details. Sometimes, even adjusting the spacing or font size can completely transform how a website feels.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Clean and modern web design is about <strong>clarity, balance, and purpose</strong>. Every color, shape, and line should have a reason to exist. When you design with intention, users notice — and they’ll remember your site for all the right reasons.</p>

        <p><em>Keep experimenting, stay inspired, and remember: simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.</em></p>
